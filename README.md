**RL4SE** stands for **Reinforcement Learning for Software Engineering**. This project leverages cutting-edge reinforcement learning algorithms to optimize and enhance software engineering processes. By applying the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm to the **LunarLander-v3** environment from OpenAI's Gymnasium, RL4SE demonstrates the practical applications of reinforcement learning in complex, real-world scenarios.

## 🔍 Description

RL4SE is a **reinforcement learning** project focused on applying the **Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO)** algorithm to the **LunarLander-v3** environment from OpenAI's Gymnasium. This project leverages **Stable Baselines3** for model implementation and **Weights & Biases (WandB)** for experiment tracking and visualization. Additionally, it incorporates **Git Large File Storage (LFS)** to manage large video recordings of agent performance.

**Key Objectives:**

- Demonstrate the effectiveness of PPO in complex environments.
- Track and visualize training metrics using WandB.
- Manage large media files efficiently with Git LFS.
- Provide a modular and scalable codebase for future enhancements.

---

## ✨ Features

- **Standard PPO Implementation:** Utilizes the PPO algorithm from Stable Baselines3 for training agents.
- **Experiment Tracking:** Integrates with WandB to monitor training progress, visualize metrics, and save code snapshots.
- **Video Recording:** Records and displays videos of the trained agent's performance.
- **Model Saving:** Saves trained models for future use and evaluation.
- **Git LFS Integration:** Manages large video files efficiently using Git Large File Storage.
- **Modular Code Structure:** Organized scripts and utilities for maintainability and scalability.
- **Configuration Flexibility:** Easily adjustable hyperparameters and environment settings.
- **Comprehensive Documentation:** Detailed instructions and explanations for ease of use.
